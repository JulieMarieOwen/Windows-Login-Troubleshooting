<h1>Help Desk Ticket: Windows Login Troubleshooting</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A user had the following issue:<br>
I changed my password recently, and now I'm totally locked out of Windows. Can't get in at all, and I don’t remember my password.
If you could help me out with this pronto, that would be awesome.

<h2>Troubleshooting Process</h2>

The user reset their password and cannot remember what it is.
I logged into the admin account and went to control panel > User Accounts > User Accounts > Manage Another Account
and chose the Learner01 account, chose Change Password and reset the password to the default “perscholas”

<h2>Resolution</h2>

- <b> Resolution (Internal): I used the admin account to go in to the user accounts and reset the password for the Learner01 account; it has been reset to the default “perscholas” and the user has been instructed to change it to something they can remember.
- <b> Resolution (Client-Facing): I was able to go in and reset your password. You can now login to your account using the password “perscholas”.  Make sure you change your password from the default to something you can easily remember.

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)
